      <h1>Nippon</h1>
      <p>
        Japan[b][a] is an island country in East Asia, located in the northwest
        Pacific Ocean. It is bordered on the west by the Sea of Japan, and
        extends from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north toward the East China Sea
        and Taiwan in the south. Part of the Ring of Fire, Japan spans an
        archipelago of 6852 islands covering 377,975 square kilometers (145,937
        sq mi); the five main islands are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, and
        Okinawa. Tokyo is Japan's capital and largest city; other major cities
        include Yokohama, Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, Fukuoka, Kobe, and Kyoto.
        Japan is the eleventh-most populous country in the world, as well as one
        of the most densely populated and urbanized. About three-fourths of the
        country's terrain is mountainous, concentrating its population of 125.36
        million on narrow coastal plains. Japan is divided into 47
        administrative prefectures and eight traditional regions. The Greater
        Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world, with
        more than 37.4 million residents. Japan has been inhabited since the
        Upper Paleolithic period (30,000 BC), though the first written mention
        of the archipelago appears in a Chinese chronicle finished in the 2nd
        century AD. Between the 4th and 9th centuries, the kingdoms of Japan
        became unified under an emperor and the imperial court based in
        Heian-kyō. Beginning in the 12th century, political power was held by a
        series of military dictators (shōgun) and feudal lords (daimyō), and
        enforced by a class of warrior nobility (samurai). After a century-long
        period of civil war, the country was reunified in 1603 under the
        Tokugawa shogunate, which enacted an isolationist foreign policy. In
        1854, a United States fleet forced Japan to open trade to the West,
        which led to the end of the shogunate and the restoration of imperial
        power in 1868. In the Meiji period, the Empire of Japan adopted a
        Western-modeled constitution and pursued a program of industrialization
        and modernization. In 1937, Japan invaded China; in 1941, it entered
        World War II as an Axis power. After suffering defeat in the Pacific War
        and two atomic bombings, Japan surrendered in 1945 and came under a
        seven-year Allied occupation, during which it adopted a new
        constitution. Under the 1947 constitution, Japan has maintained a
        unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy with a bicameral
        legislature, the National Diet. Japan is a great power and a member of
        numerous international organizations, including the United Nations
        (since 1956), the OECD, and the Group of Seven. Although it has
        renounced its right to declare war, the country maintains Self-Defense
        Forces that rank as one of the world's strongest militaries. After World
        War II, Japan experienced record growth in an economic miracle, becoming
        the second-largest economy in the world by 1990. As of 2021, the
        country's economy is the third-largest by nominal GDP and the
        fourth-largest by PPP. A global leader in the automotive and electronics
        industries, Japan has made significant contributions to science and
        technology. Ranked "very high" on the Human Development Index, Japan has
        one of the world's highest life expectancies, though it is experiencing
        a decline in population. The culture of Japan is well known around the
        world, including its art, cuisine, music, and popular culture, which
        encompasses prominent comic, animation and video game industries.

      <h1>Etymology</h1>
      <p>
        he name for Japan in Japanese is written using the kanji 日本 and
        pronounced Nippon or Nihon.[9] Before 日本 was adopted in the early 8th
        century, the country was known in China as Wa (倭) and in Japan by the
        endonym Yamato.[10] Nippon, the original Sino-Japanese reading of the
        characters, is favored for official uses, including on banknotes and
        postage stamps.[9] Nihon is typically used in everyday speech and
        reflects shifts in Japanese phonology during the Edo period.[10] The
        characters 日本 mean "sun origin",[9] which is the source of the popular
        Western epithet "Land of the Rising Sun".[11] The name Japan is based on
        the Chinese pronunciation of 日本 and was introduced to European
        languages through early trade. In the 13th century, Marco Polo recorded
        the early Mandarin or Wu Chinese pronunciation of the characters 日本國
        as Cipangu.[12] The old Malay name for Japan, Japang or Japun, was
        borrowed from a southern coastal Chinese dialect and encountered by
        Portuguese traders in Southeast Asia, who brought the word to Europe in
        the early 16th century.[13] The first version of the name in English
        appears in a book published in 1577, which spelled the name as Giapan in
        a translation of a 1565 Portuguese letter

      <h1>History</h1>
      <p>
        A Paleolithic culture from around 30,000 BC constitutes the first known
        habitation of the islands of Japan.[16] This was followed from around
        14,500 BC (the start of the Jōmon period) by a Mesolithic to Neolithic
        semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and
        rudimentary agriculture.[17] Clay vessels from the period are among the
        oldest surviving examples of pottery.[18] From around 1000 BC, Yayoi
        people began to enter the archipelago from Kyushu, intermingling with
        the Jōmon;[19] the Yayoi period saw the introduction of practices
        including wet-rice farming,[20] a new style of pottery,[21] and
        metallurgy from China and Korea.[22] According to legend, Emperor Jimmu
        (grandson of Amaterasu) founded a kingdom in central Japan in 660 BC,
        beginning a continuous imperial line.[23] Japan first appears in written
        history in the Chinese Book of Han, completed in 111 AD. Buddhism was
        introduced to Japan from Baekje (a Korean kingdom) in 552, but the
        development of Japanese Buddhism was primarily influenced by China.[24]
        Despite early resistance, Buddhism was promoted by the ruling class,
        including figures like Prince Shōtoku, and gained widespread acceptance
        beginning in the Asuka period (592–710).[25] The far-reaching Taika
        Reforms in 645 nationalized all land in Japan, to be distributed equally
        among cultivators, and ordered the compilation of a household registry
        as the basis for a new system of taxation.[26] The Jinshin War of 672, a
        bloody conflict between Prince Ōama and his nephew Prince Ōtomo, became
        a major catalyst for further administrative reforms.[27] These reforms
        culminated with the promulgation of the Taihō Code, which consolidated
        existing statutes and established the structure of the central and
        subordinate local governments.[26] These legal reforms created the
        ritsuryō state, a system of Chinese-style centralized government that
        remained in place for half a millennium.[27] The Nara period (710–784)
        marked the emergence of a Japanese state centered on the Imperial Court
        in Heijō-kyō (modern Nara). The period is characterized by the
        appearance of a nascent literary culture with the completion of the
        Kojiki (712) and Nihon Shoki (720), as well as the development of
        Buddhist-inspired artwork and architecture.[28][29] A smallpox epidemic
        in 735–737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of Japan's
        population.[29][30] In 784, Emperor Kanmu moved the capital, settling on
        Heian-kyō (modern Kyoto) in 794.[29] This marked the beginning of the
        Heian period (794–1185), during which a distinctly indigenous Japanese
        culture emerged. Murasaki Shikibu's The Tale of Genji and the lyrics of
        Japan's national anthem "Kimigayo" were written during this time

      <h1>Geography</h1>
      <p>
        Japan comprises 6852 islands extending along the Pacific coast of Asia.
        It stretches over 3000 km (1900 mi) northeast–southwest from the Sea of
        Okhotsk to the East China Sea.[70][71] The country's five main islands,
        from north to south, are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu and
        Okinawa.[72] The Ryukyu Islands, which include Okinawa, are a chain to
        the south of Kyushu. The Nanpō Islands are south and east of the main
        islands of Japan. Together they are often known as the Japanese
        archipelago.[73] As of 2019, Japan's territory is 377,975.24 km2
        (145,937.06 sq mi).[2] Japan has the sixth longest coastline in the
        world at 29,751 km (18,486 mi). Because of its far-flung outlying
        islands, Japan has the sixth largest Exclusive Economic Zone in the
        world, covering 4,470,000 km2 (1,730,000 sq mi).[74][75] Because of its
        mountainous terrain, approximately 67% of Japan's land is
        uninhabitable.[76] The habitable zones, mainly in coastal areas, have
        extremely high population densities: Japan is one of the most densely
        populated countries.[77][78] As of 2014, approximately 0.5% of Japan's
        total area is reclaimed land (umetatechi).[79] Japan is substantially
        prone to earthquakes, tsunami and volcanoes because of its location
        along the Pacific Ring of Fire.[80] It has the 17th highest natural
        disaster risk as measured in the 2016 World Risk Index.[81] Japan has
        111 active volcanoes.[82] Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in
        tsunami, occur several times each century;[83] the 1923 Tokyo earthquake
        killed over 140,000 people.[84] More recent major quakes are the 1995
        Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, which triggered
        a large tsunami

      <h1>Politics</h1>
      <p>
        Japan is a unitary state and constitutional monarchy in which the power
        of the Emperor is limited to a ceremonial role.[104] Executive power is
        instead wielded by the Prime Minister of Japan and his Cabinet, whose
        sovereignty is vested in the Japanese people.[105] Naruhito is the
        Emperor of Japan, having succeeded his father Akihito upon his accession
        to the Chrysanthemum Throne in 2019.[104] The National Diet Building
        Japan's legislative organ is the National Diet, a bicameral
        parliament.[104] It consists of a lower House of Representatives with
        465 seats, elected by popular vote every four years or when dissolved,
        and an upper House of Councillors with 245 seats, whose
        popularly-elected members serve six-year terms.[106] There is universal
        suffrage for adults over 18 years of age,[107] with a secret ballot for
        all elected offices.[105] The prime minister as the head of government
        has the power to appoint and dismiss Ministers of State, and is
        appointed by the emperor after being designated from among the members
        of the Diet.[106] Elected in the 2020 Japanese prime minister election,
        Yoshihide Suga is Japan's prime minister.[108] Historically influenced
        by Chinese law, the Japanese legal system developed independently during
        the Edo period through texts such as Kujikata Osadamegaki.[109] Since
        the late 19th century, the judicial system has been largely based on the
        civil law of Europe, notably Germany. In 1896, Japan established a civil
        code based on the German Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch, which remains in
        effect with post–World War II modifications.[110] The Constitution of
        Japan, adopted in 1947, is the oldest unamended constitution in the
        world.[111] Statutory law originates in the legislature, and the
        constitution requires that the emperor promulgate legislation passed by
        the Diet without giving him the power to oppose legislation. The main
        body of Japanese statutory law is called the Six Codes.[109] Japan's
        court system is divided into four basic tiers: the Supreme Court and
        three levels of lower courts
